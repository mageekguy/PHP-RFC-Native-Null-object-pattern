# RFC about native implementation of the Null Object Pattern in PHP

The [Null Object Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) is a very powerful tool to speed up development, decrease complexity and increase readability of Object Oriented code.

This repositoty centralize the development of a RFC for [PHP](http://php.net), according to the [PHP RFC Process](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/howto).

So the roadmap is:

1. Add a pro/cons section in the proposal ;
2. Email @internals list to measure reaction to our proposal ;
3. Create the RFC and a POC of a technical implementation ;
4. Publish the RFC on the wiki and debate about it with internals@.

Currently, the first step is a work in progress.
